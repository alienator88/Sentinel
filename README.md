A GUI for controlling Gatekeeper and more, written in SwiftUI. Using this as a learning opportunity for Swift as I'm new to it.


## Features
- 100% Swift
- Can drop an app in the drop target to unquarantine
- Can drop an app in the drop target to ad-hoc self sign and replace the certificate
- Custom auto-updater that pulls latest release notes and binaries from GitHub Releases (Sentinel should be ran from /Applications folder to avoid permission issues)
- Supports macOS Sequoia

## Requirements
- MacOS 12.0+ (App uses a lot of newer SwiftUI functions/modifiers which don't work on any OS lower than 12.0)
