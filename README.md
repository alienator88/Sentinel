A GUI for controlling Gatekeeper, unquarantining apps and signing apps.


## Features
- 100% Swift
- Can drop an app in the drop target to unquarantine and optionally auto-open the app after it is unquarantined
- Can drop an app in the drop target to ad-hoc self sign and replace the certificate
- Custom auto-updater that pulls latest release notes and binaries from GitHub Releases (Sentinel should be ran from /Applications folder to avoid permission issues)
- Supports macOS Sequoia
